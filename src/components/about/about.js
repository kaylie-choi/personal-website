                I was national champion and 5-time member of the <Link to='http://www.gymcan.org/disciplines/rhythmic/national-teams/kaylie-choi' target='_blank'>
                    <AboutBold>Canadian Rhythmic Gymnastics National Team</AboutBold>
                </Link> where I had the opportunity to represent Canada at several international 
                competitions. Since retiring, I've coached and mentored several young athletes 
                - I hope to give back to the community that helped raise me. 
                <br/>
                In my spare time, I love hiking, going on foodventures, and
                discovering new music... but can usually be found spending way too many hours on TikTok.
